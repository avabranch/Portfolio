                    <div class="mb-0">This independent study explores how Black feminist approaches to memory and oral history can open new ways of understanding Davidson College’s institutional past. Though rooted in scholarship on Black women’s experiences, these frameworks—particularly their commitments to care, relationality, and lived experience—offer critical tools for interpreting histories that sit outside traditional archives.
Davidson’s official records largely privilege administrative and student leadership perspectives, leaving the lives of those who lived and worked in the margins underdocumented. This project centers oral history as both method and ethics, treating narratives from Black residents of the Town of Davidson, long-serving campus staff, early Black students, and individuals in “in-between” roles as forms of historical knowledge rather than archival supplement.
Drawing on the work of Barbara Savage, Robyn Spencer, Nishani Frazier, O. Jennifer Dixon-McKnight, and Laura Lovett, the study builds interview networks through alumni and community connections, with a particular focus on Black Davidson alumni. These narratives foreground the affective, racial, and spatial dimensions of the institution while informing ongoing archival, museum, and descendant community engagement efforts.
Research findings will be presented in a public-facing format in May, with additional outputs forthcoming.</div>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Inventing the Illegal Alien: Remaking Citizenship in the Reagan Era (2025)</div>
                    <p class="mb-0">This capstone project examines how the Reagan administration reshaped American citizenship and belonging through immigration policy and public discourse between 1980 and 1987, with a focus on the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. Drawing on primary source research conducted at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the project analyzes newspapers, periodicals, presidential rhetoric, and congressional debates to understand how IRCA was framed as a humane, bipartisan reform. I argue that the legislation redefined legality not as a political right, but as a moralized and bureaucratic measure of worth, embedding new forms of conditional belonging within immigration law.
Developed over six months, the project combines close archival reading with corpus-assisted textual analysis of Congressional Records using AntConc. Informed by Michel Foucault’s theories of governance and discipline, this methodological approach traces recurring metaphors and moral vocabularies that constructed immigration as a crisis requiring administrative control. By situating IRCA within the broader neoliberal and media transformations of the 1980s, the project demonstrates how ostensibly neutral bureaucratic mechanisms—such as employer sanctions and documentation requirements—masked inequality while institutionalizing hierarchies that continue to shape contemporary debates over citizenship and legality.</p>
